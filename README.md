# UFO Sightings
### Javascript Homework Challenge for GA Tech Data Analytics Bootcamp

Our Data Analytics team was contracted by Aliens-R-Real to create a website that will enable their volunteers to view and search through their database of UFO sights by date/time. It was also requested that the website will update as the data set expands with additional sightings.

Since the Aliens-R-Real data team will be managing the site once it has been launched, we restricted site construction tools to JavaScript, D3, HTML and CSS, based on their team's current capabilties.
